	abstract = {A framework is developed to explore the connection between effective optimization algorithms and the problems they are solving. A number of "no free lunch" ({NFL}) theorems are presented which establish that for any algorithm, any elevated performance over one class of problems is offset by performance over another class. These theorems result in a geometric interpretation of what it means for an algorithm to be well suited to an optimization problem. Applications of the {NFL} theorems to information-theoretic aspects of optimization and benchmark measures of performance are also presented. Other issues addressed include time-varying optimization problems and a priori "head-to-head" minimax distinctions between optimization algorithms, distinctions that result despite the {NFL} theorems' enforcing of a type of uniformity over all algorithms.},

	url = {https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Artificial_intelligence_in_video_games&oldid=1292216335},
	abstract = {In video games, artificial intelligence ({AI}) is used to generate responsive, adaptive or intelligent behaviors primarily in non-playable characters ({NPCs}) similar to human-like intelligence. Artificial intelligence has been an integral part of video games since their inception in 1948, first seen in the game Nim. {AI} in video games is a distinct subfield and differs from academic {AI}. It serves to improve the game-player experience rather than machine learning or decision making. During the golden age of arcade video games the idea of {AI} opponents was largely popularized in the form of graduated difficulty levels, distinct movement patterns, and in-game events dependent on the player's input. Modern games often implement existing techniques such as pathfinding and decision trees to guide the actions of {NPCs}. {AI} is often used in mechanisms which are not immediately visible to the user, such as data mining and procedural-content generation. One of the most infamous examples of this {NPC} technology and gradual difficulty levels can be found in the game Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! (1987).  
In general, game {AI} does not, as might be thought and sometimes is depicted to be the case, mean a realization of an artificial person corresponding to an {NPC} in the manner of the Turing test or an artificial general intelligence.},
